This is the code used for DEPICT analysis of ExomeChip data for BMI and WHR.
It is almost the same as the code used for height, with a few minor
differences (creating clumped null backgrounds + some of the output formats
are a little different).

In the source/ folder, there are three pieces of code.

To create null backgrounds for analysis:
1. obesity_sort_nulls_and_order_genes_clumped.py: example config file in
example/example_obesity_sort_nulls_and_order_genes_clumped.cfg.
This takes in each EC permutation, sorts by variants by p-value, and assigns
each to a gene. Outputs a ranked list of genes for each permutation, which is
used as input for the next piece of code.
2. obesity-EC-DEPICT_forNulls.py: example config file in
example/example_obesity-EC-DEPICT_forNulls.cfg 
Example output is in example/example.nullorderedgenes
This takes in ranked gene list from script #1 and calculates the test
statistic for each permutation for each gene set. The number of input genes
used to calculate null test statistic (i.e. how many genes to take from the
top of the list for each permutation) must be matched to the number of
significant genes used in the actual data. Outputs a null test statistic for
each gene set for each permutation, which is used as a background file in
script #3.
Example output is in example/example.nullteststatistic.

For actual gene set enrichment (using null background created by script #1 and
script #2):
3. obesity-EC-DEPICT.py: Performs the gene set enrichment analysis. Example
input file in example/example_obesity-EC-DEPICT_forNulls.cfg.


Reconstituted gene sets can be found at:

The analyses file contain the full results for BMI and WHR. See README in that
folder for interpretations.

Data files (in data/):
GO.terms_alt_ids_withoutheader.tab, VOC_MammalianPhenotype.rpt, and
inweb_mapping.tab contain mappings from gene set IDs to full names.

metacluster_labels.txt contains meta-gene set assignments for each gene set.

mart_export_EnsemblConversion_hg19.txt contains mappings from HUGO to Ensembl
IDs.

obesity.filteredvariantannotations contains the variant annotations for
ExomeChip SNPs that meet all filter criteria (present in BMI data, present in
null ExomeChip data, annotation in CHARGE file is nonsynonymous or splice,
gene is present in DEPICT). Annotations come from CHARGE consortium,
obesity_MAFLess5.filteredvariantannotation is the same, but using only
variants with a MAF less than .05. (These will be posted after paper is
published).
